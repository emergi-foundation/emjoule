Decentralized Application for Community Choice Aggregation

Emjoule is a decentralized application for community choice aggregation of distributed energy resources. Emjoule is a set of smart contracts that enable distributed energy resource consumers and producers (prosumers) to aggregate their energy choices as a community. This coordination increases the cost and technical effectiveness of energy resources that are individually owned and controlled at the edge of the grid, such as rooftop solar panels, electric vehicles, and smart home devices. The decentralized application architecture allows a diverse set of households and service providers to coordinate along transparent rules to manage risk in the energy market, and for the supply chain of energy to be transparently traced and verified for each participant.

Smart contracts are written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, with a minimal frontend deployed to IPFS. The primary smart contract governing the ecosystem is architected according to ERC-1155 and progresses through the process of procuring verifiably clean energy.
